<p>This creature born from another world was able to materialize because of the Dark Elixir.

    no wall can stop it anymore! 
    A world of hurt is the only thing waiting for those who are coward enough to seek protection from walls.

<p>A Golem is a colossal mass of rocks. That being said, a Golem obviously specializes in defense. 
    Its impenetrable skin absorbs attacks of all kinds. 
    And if it so happens that it gets damaged, it will simply split into tinier golems. Such a terrifying beast!

<p>Attack Style:  Single Target</p>
<p>Movement Speed: 20</p>
<p>For some reason, a Lava Hound can’t help but target air defenses. 
    No one knows why, but at least there’s something reliable that can fight those pesky air defenses. 
    A Lava Hound has a temper as hot as its flames. 
    It’s so resilient that it won’t even succumb to death without a fight. 
    As a matter of fact, once it is pushed to its limits, 
    it will split into smaller lava pups that can fight just as hard.
